# Wisp
## Global Domination
### Platforms Provide Exclusive Space
No one but the developer has access to the process space.
If it's in there, you put it there.
"Because someone might..." is never valid.
### Configure Space as a Purpose-Built Machine
#### Extend Environment 
#### Add Fixtures
##### C#
Fixtures are static classes in the global space
##### JS
Fixtures are static classes on self
#### Add Tooling 

## Passing Comms
Wisp is about transfer of control.
WispNodes do a job and pass the user to the next Wisp 
Internally sockets are also transfered.
When a process is active it "owns" the port and IO.

## Virtual Source Files (VSource)
Hand written and manually managed sources files are a problem.
Any other business would have automated long ago.

### Conservation of Complexity


## Software Manufacturing
### Tool and Die Shops

## Custom Elms and Sheets (CES)
### Taxels
